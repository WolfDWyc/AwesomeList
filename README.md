# AwesomeList
load all 4 java files to your java IDE
used as a faster list implementation
example:
List<Integer> myList = new AwesomeList<>();
that's it! 
(AwesomeList should be faster than both ArrayList and LinkedList,
but takes a bit more space depending on your usage.
feel free to change the 'def' value, lower def = slower but takes less space).
