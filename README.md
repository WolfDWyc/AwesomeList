# Note

I made this project when I had a lot less knowledge in programming.

There is no project file, no directory structure, no docs and no maven dependency.

I'm not even sure if it actually outperforms both because the tests I made were unprofessional.

Leaving this public for now because I still think it's cool and i'm proud of it as a beginner project.

# AwesomeList

AwesomeList is a java list implementation that outperforms both arraylist and linkedlist

example:

`List<Integer> myList = new AwesomeList<>();`

that's it! 

(AwesomeList should be faster than both ArrayList and LinkedList,
but takes a bit more space depending on your usage.
feel free to change the 'def' value, lower def = slower but takes less space).
