# AwesomeList
load all 4 java files to your java IDE

AwesomeList is a java list implementation that outperforms both arraylist and linkedlist

example:

List<Integer> myList = new AwesomeList<>();

that's it! 

(AwesomeList should be faster than both ArrayList and LinkedList,
but takes a bit more space depending on your usage.
feel free to change the 'def' value, lower def = slower but takes less space).
